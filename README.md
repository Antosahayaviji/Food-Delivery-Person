# 📑Content

This portal is created with `HTML` </>, `CSS` { }, `Javascript` { ... and `React` ⚛️.
* This is a 🖥️ `responsive website` which can be accessible in all devices.
* Here, for better visibility we have added the vertical navigation, that is visible in the desktop view, and when we change to mobile view, the vertical navigation will come to bottom navigation
* This delivery app contains four different insights like 🏠`Home`, 📦 `Orders`, 🔔`Notification` and 👤`Profile`.
* In the 🏠 `Home page`, we have placed a switch that replicates the driver status as ᯤ`Online` or 📵 `Offline`.
* If the Driver status is ᯤ`online`, the present delivery details will show along with the 💲`today earnings`, 🛒🛍️`completed order`, 🕘`working hours` and ↔️`distance`.
* Also, in the 🏠 `homepage` we have a support option with a { }`API assistant`.
* In  📦`order page`, we have three insights like ⏳`Active`, ✅`Completed` and ❌`Cancelled`.
* In the ⏳ `active`, we can see the 📑 `present delivery status` along with the 📌 navigation `address` and in the ✅ `completed section` we can see the `orders completed` along with the 🧾`payment details` and in the ❌`order cancelled` we can see the `cancelled details`.
* In the 🔔 `notification page`, we can see the 📦`order details`, ✅`completed order payment details` and ❌`cancelled order details` along with the 🚩`milestone reached` and the ⚙️ `system update`.
* In the 👤 `profile section`, we can see the ⭐ `driver's rating`, their 💲`eraning overview`, 🏍️`vehicle details`, 📈`performance status` and ⚙️`settings`. Under the ⚙️ `settings`, we can change the features to ☀︎`dark mode` and also we can ☾☼`increase and decrease the brightness`. Also, we can ➜]`logout` and ➜🚪`login` this features.
